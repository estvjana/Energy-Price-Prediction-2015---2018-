# Energy Price Prediction (2015-2018)
This project, created during our first year of college, investigates the impact of various energy sources on electricity costs in Spain from 2015 to 2018. By examining how the mix of renewable and fossil fuel-based power sources correlates with changes in electricity prices, this analysis provides valuable insights that can inform decision-making and shape future energy policies.

# Description
The project explores how energy generation from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass) and fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) impacted electricity prices in Spain from 2015 to 2018. 
The aim is to understand the correlation between the mix of these power sources and changes in electricity prices. The findings can inform decision-making and future energy policies.

# Key Findings
### Income Disparity:
Higher generation of renewable energy sources leads to lower electricity prices compared to non-renewable sources.

### Market Dynamics: 
Renewable energy adoption impacts electricity pricing, driven by factors like renewable penetration, cost efficiency, and market regulations.

### Economic Trends:
Recessions and economic policies impact wage gaps, sometimes marginally reducing disparities.

# Context and Implications
Renewable energy sources have become vital worldwide, driving economic growth and development beyond merely powering homes and industries. Spain has emerged as a leader in renewable energy, leveraging its strategic location and favorable weather conditions. The study highlights the impact of renewable energy adoption on electricity prices, which is crucial for sustainable economic growth and environmental protection.

# Ethical Considerations

### Harms: 
High volatility in electricity prices can lead to economic instability and social inequality, disproportionately affecting lower-income households.
### Benefits: 
Accurate price predictions ensure just pricing, promote investment in sustainable technologies, and enhance economic resilience by stabilizing national economies against volatile global fuel markets.

# Measurement
The dataset includes energy generation and electricity prices in Spain from 2015 to 2018. Key variables include the quantity of electricity generated from renewable and fossil fuel sources, and actual market prices of electricity. Statistical methods like regression analysis explore correlations between these variables.

# Data Section
The dataset consists of energy generation amounts, weather patterns, and energy prices in Spain from 2015 through 2018. Missing data were handled using the .fillna() function. The analysis involves training regression models (linear regression, random forest, KNN) to predict energy prices based on renewable and non-renewable generation.

# Conclusion
The analysis shows that higher renewable energy generation leads to lower energy prices. Regression models indicate a measurable difference in how renewable and non-renewable sources impact actual prices. External factors like government intervention, consumer influence, infrastructure, and resource availability in Spain also play a role in energy pricing.
